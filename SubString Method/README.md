# ✂️ StringSubstringExample.java

## 📄 Description

This program demonstrates the use of Java's `.substring(index)` method, which extracts a portion of a string starting from the specified index to the end. 
In this case, the program transforms `"king Charles"` into `"Charles"` by starting the substring from index 5.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To understand how to extract part of a string from a specific position.
- To show how string slicing can be used for formatting, parsing, or data cleaning.
- To practice string reassignment after substring operations.

## ✅ Advantages

- Useful in trimming unwanted parts (e.g., removing prefixes).
- Ideal for extracting meaningful segments of data (like names, IDs, etc.).
- Helps in breaking down structured text (e.g., filenames, dates, etc.).

## 📚 Learning Outcome

After reviewing this example, learners will:
- Know how to use `.substring(index)` effectively.
- Understand how string indices work and how substring output is determined.
- Gain confidence in applying string manipulation techniques in Java.
