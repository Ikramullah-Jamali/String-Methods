# 🔍 SubstringWithRangeExample.java

## 📄 Description

This Java program demonstrates the use of the `.substring(startIndex, endIndex)` method, which extracts a specific portion of a string between two indices. 
In this example, the string `"king khan"` is used, and the substring from index `0` to `5` is extracted.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To understand how to extract a segment from a string using a range of indices.
- To learn the difference between single-argument and two-argument `substring()` usage.
- To apply controlled string slicing for formatting and parsing tasks.

## ✅ Advantages

- Enables precise extraction of characters or words from strings.
- Ideal for processing structured data like names, IDs, or tokens.
- Useful in parsing input, breaking strings into sections, or formatting output.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

After reviewing this example, learners will:
- Understand how `.substring(startIndex, endIndex)` behaves.
- Learn how string indexing works (inclusive of start, exclusive of end).
- Be able to apply substring logic to real-world scenarios like name formatting or text processing.
