# 🔤 StringCharAtExample.java

## 📄 Description

This program demonstrates the use of the `.charAt()` method in Java, which is used to access characters at specific positions in a string. 
The program takes a name (`Ikram`) and prints each character individually by looping through the string.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To understand how to extract individual characters from a string using `.charAt()`.
- To learn basic string traversal using a loop.
- To develop familiarity with string indexing in Java.

## ✅ Advantages

- Helps in character-by-character string analysis.
- Useful for input validation, character searching, or string manipulation.
- Builds foundation for more complex tasks like palindrome checking or encryption.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

By studying this example, learners will be able to:
- Use `.charAt(index)` confidently.
- Understand how string length and indexing work together.
- Write basic string traversal logic.

## 📂 Part of Repository
