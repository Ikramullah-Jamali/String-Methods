# 🔍 indexOf() Method Examples in Java

This folder contains two Java programs that demonstrate the use of the `.indexOf()` method, which is used to find the position of characters or substrings within a string.

---

## 📄 1. StringIndexOfExample.java

### 📌 Description
This program finds the index of a specific character in a string using `.indexOf()`. It simply checks where the character `"n"` appears first in the string `"Student"`.

### 🎯 Purpose
- To introduce the basic use of `.indexOf(String)` or `.indexOf(char)` in Java.
- To help learners understand how Java handles string searching.

### ✅ Advantages
- Helps detect the first occurrence of characters or substrings.
- Frequently used in form validation, search algorithms, and substring extraction.

## 📄 2. SearchSubstringFromIndex.java

### 📌 Description
This program demonstrates how to search for a character or substring starting from a specific index using `.indexOf(String, fromIndex)` or `.indexOf(char, fromIndex)`.

### 🎯 Purpose
- To show how to control the starting point of a search within a string.
- Useful when avoiding earlier matches or continuing searches from a specific point.

### ✅ Advantages
- Gives more control in complex string parsing.
- Useful for handling repeated patterns, loops, or when working with large text.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

By reviewing both programs, learners will:
- Understand how `.indexOf()` behaves with and without a starting index.
- Learn to retrieve character positions for both single characters and substrings.
- Be able to apply string search logic in real-world problems.
