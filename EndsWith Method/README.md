# 🔚 StringEndsWithExample.java

## 📄 Description

This program illustrates the use of the `.endsWith()` method in Java. The method checks whether a given string ends with a specific sequence of characters. 
In this example, it evaluates whether the string `"Student"` ends with `"ent"`.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To demonstrate how to verify the suffix of a string.
- To show how string comparison can be applied for conditional checks.
- To reinforce practical usage of Java String methods.

## ✅ Advantages

- Useful in input validation, especially when checking file extensions (like `.txt`, `.jpg`, etc.).
- Helps in filtering strings based on patterns or specific endings.
- Enhances understanding of string operations, improving code readability and logic building.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

By studying this example, learners will:
- Understand how `.endsWith(String suffix)` works.
- Be able to apply suffix checks in real-world situations.
- Improve decision-making using conditional statements with string methods.
